##Matador Scripts

Author: Kim Wu

2 very simple scripts made in Scrapy. 

###Matador:
#####Run in the command line:   
#####scrapy crawl matador -o items.csv -t csv

Will compile a csv of all names and url of drugs. 


Notes: Technically this could have been done with a CrawlSpider, but it would have slighlty overcomplicated the issue. Hence, 2 base spiders were used.
